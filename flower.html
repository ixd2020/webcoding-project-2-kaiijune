          Feature Google Design’s Best of 2020 A look back at the year’s most
          resilient design projects By Google Design Illustrations by Haik
          Avanian When we left our desks back in March, we didn’t think twice
          about leaving our office plants and reading glasses behind. Days
          became weeks, weeks stretched to months. (We eventually said goodbye
          to the fiddle leaf figs). Soon we were sharing
          <a href="error.html">tips on how to work together while apart</a>, and
          recognizing a fundamental
          <a href="error.html">shift in the way we work</a>. The resiliency of
          our Google colleagues was never in doubt, but this year we saw them
          flex and adapt in exciting new directions, all while meeting people
          where they are (usually at home), to deliver experiences that made us
          feel more connected, informed, and optimistic than ever. Most of the
          work we reviewed for this year’s annual revue was created remotely,
          during a global pandemic, and is shaped by that context. And yet, we
          think you’ll find that the noteworthy projects—including crowdsourced
          earthquake alerts and variable fonts—add up to a stellar year for UX
          at Google. As we look ahead to 2021 (praise be!) take a minute to
          applaud the work and the people who made 2020 sing.

        This year, the lowly living room doubled as classroom, chem lab, and
        concert hall, but screens were the true MVP—especially for the
        school-age set. AI-powered homework help is just a smartphone snap away
        with the inventive Socratic app, while Kids Space helps little ones
        explore their unique interests via “teacher-approved” books, games, and
        videos (a godsend with after-school programs on pause). If music lessons
        are what you or your kids miss most, enter Shared Piano, a web app by
        Google Creative Lab that’s designed specifically for remote teaching and
        collaboration. Send a link to your instructor and start jamming.

        For home-bound gallery-goers, the Google Arts & Culture team will bring
        the museum to you. Thanks to a combination of street view mapping and
        high-res imagery, anyone can take a virtual stroll through the world’s
        top cultural institutions. Want to bop over to Versailles? No problemo.
        Waltz your way through the Palace Museum? Go for it. Or, use an
        AR-assist to step inside a Pocket Gallery created in partnership with
        the National Museum in New Delhi to put 1,000+ miniature paintings on
        display. For the readers among us, get lost exploring An Ocean of Books,
        a poetic ML experiment where author islands on a fantasy map—trust us,
        it’s otherworldly—lead to new literary connections between the most
        famous titles in the Google Books collection. We applaud the tech that
        helped small businesses go beyond brick and mortar, and kept us close
        throughout 2020. Google Food Ordering brought no-contact delivery to
        doorsteps, while Reserve with Google gave 600k+ merchants a way to offer
        their services virtually. For need-to-try-before-you-buy products,
        Google Shopping teamed up with several beauty brands to create an AR app
        that lets you try on (virtual) makeup at home. The team prioritized
        inclusivity and hyperrealism, using extensive research to ensure the
        experience worked for everyone. Nest launched an initiative to help
        seniors stay in touch with family and loved ones, while staying apart.
        Project Merrill gave nearly 1,000 Nest Hub Max devices to quarantined
        residents in seven Washington State retirement communities. Each was
        pre-loaded with contacts for quick video calls to the grandkids, and a
        Google Assistant experience designed especially for less tech-savvy
        folks.

        Tools that make making easier
      </h1>
      <p>
        We’re biased, but the most versatile tool in the 2020 Google-verse is
        Google Workspace, a new identity and an even more connected experience
        for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet, Sheets, and Slides (to name a few).
        “Since we first introduced G Suite back in early 2016, the way we work
        has evolved,” Margaret Cyphers, UX & Creative Director of Google
        Workspace, tells us. “Our work has shifted to be even more connected and
        collaborative.” The transition to WFH gave Cyphers and her team
        increased urgency to ensure that these products not only work together
        seamlessly, but meet people where they are—in new work environments,
        constantly juggling personal and professional responsibilities (who has
        time to open another tab or app anyway?). Think of Google Workspace as
        your productivity multi-tool.

        Tools that empower creators to make more, also top our list. Tone
        Transfer by the Magenta and AIUX team within Google Research creates
        impossible melodies. The more realistic-sounding synthesizer adds
        machine learning to the music-making process, transforming your own
        vocals into an improvisational jazz trumpet or a flute into chirping
        birds. Use Soli Sandbox by Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects
        (ATAP) team to create web-based prototypes that can detect gestures
        (reach, swipe, tap) on the Pixel 4. Need a Soli primer first? Read our
        feature on the emotional intelligence behind this tiny, but powerful
        radar chip. New YouTube features help creators better protect their
        content and demystify ad guidance. Premiere Countdowns build
        anticipation for an upcoming video, by greeting viewers with a custom
        countdown as they tune in for a video debut. Creators can even pick from
        a library of countdowns by some of our favorite artists like Ash Thorp,
        Arina Shabinova, HunterGatherer, and Lucas Zanotto.

        Small gestures towards big change
      </h1>
      <p>
        TA look back at 2020 isn’t complete without acknowledging the actions
        many took towards greater, collective change. Continued investment in
        healthier digital habits and new research led to face retouching
        guidelines, and incremental changes to the Pixel phone and Android
        camera app that promote wellbeing. Zooming out, Chromecast screensavers
        served up voting info nationwide, and a project by Google Arts & Culture
        Lab made climate data more engaging. Instead of complicated graphs and
        charts, digital artworks take concepts like glacial retreat and make
        them easier to grok.

        In the midst of a global health crisis, teams across the company
        mobilized: UX writers drafted internal guidance for writing about
        COVID-19, ensuring clear and cohesive messaging: Creative Labs in London
        and New York shipped helpful tools like Sodar, a way to visualize social
        distancing, and Scannable Signs, a QR-code sign generator as a
        contactless way to collect orders, tips, make appointments, or leave
        reviews; Assistant teamed up Google Health to launch self-screening for
        COVID-19 symptoms, and then with Search and Maps to help local
        businesses share what health and safety measures they have in place;
        Google.org Fellows collaborated across seven different time zones on
        Global.health to share public health data with institutions. Teams also
        worked toward more equity and inclusion in our products. Google Kids
        Space launched with over 1,000 unique avatar assets—featuring everything
        from vitiligo to face masks—kids can mix and match to reflect their
        current or future selves. Gender equity work yielded Safe Folder, a way
        for anyone to safeguard files on a shared Android device, while Chrome
        released better password protection and more intuitive privacy settings
        (like bumping the beloved ‘clear browsing data’ button to the top, and a
        new tool to tell you when your saved passwords have been compromised and
        how to fix them)—steps towards a safer internet for everyone. Lookout
        app from the Central Accessibility team got a redesign, including new
        ways to scan entire pages and food products without a barcode.

        Soft tech that leaves us feeling fuzzy inside

      <p>
        Did someone say cozy season? This year we got reaaaaal close with our
        devices. As our collective screen time skyrocketed, Google hardware
        designers pulled the nature-inspired swipe for this year’s launches,
        which Google Seed Studio reflected in a series of videos and visuals
        that highlight the inspiration behind these products. “In times when
        life can feel so hectic, we want our devices to visually and tactilely
        reflect a moment of calm,” says Lead Industrial Designer Linda Jiang. On
        the same wavelength, Head of Human Centered Innovation & Strategy Hector
        Ouilhet advocated for more warmth in human computing in a recent op-ed:
        “If designed right, ambient computing can subtly enhance people’s
        relationships with other people and the natural world around them, just
        as ambient lighting makes a living room feel warmer and ambient music
        makes a conversation flow smoother.”

              We’ve got a soft spot for the latest Pixel devices, which make
              great strides in reducing their carbon footprint. The silky soft
              finish on the Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G is made from post-consumer
              recycled material, while the Pixel 5 is the first phone to use
              100% recycled aluminum, and 38% bio-resin on the enclosure. 💆‍♀️♻️

        Designers and technologists can envision more resilient futures by
        looking to the natural world. At least that’s the provocation put forth
        by Google AI’s Strategy & Research team in a fascinating piece we
        featured on Google Design this past summer. The writers posit that
        natural qualities like distributed, diverse, and mutual—offer us a
        playbook for building systems that can adapt and thrive, regardless of
        changing environments. (Something we could all use to help us through
        2020). To see just what they mean, look no further than a few of our
        favorite future-ready projects.

        Earthquake Alert System relies on a distributed network—each Android
        phone acts as a mini seismometer—to form the world’s largest earthquake
        detection network. The Google Flood Forecasting Initiative expanded the
        reach of its service to all of India, and improved the quality of alerts
        by partnering with several like-minded organizations to keep people safe
        and informed. A redesign of Google Maps, reveals more of the earth’s
        details by streamlining a palette of 700+ colors down to 25—while
        creating a stronger foundation for future updates and making the Map
        more accessible.

        This year, Google Fonts turned ten in style with the launch of a shiny
        new site, and support for variable fonts. The nifty type technology
        allows fonts to flex based on various axes, like width, slant, and
        thickness. Fraunces by Undercase Type is one such example. This “Old
        Style” but not Old Style (wink, wink) serif was inspired by early 20th
        century display typefaces such as Windsor, Souvenir, and Cooper Black.
        The font’s lovely microsite lets you dial in the ‘wonk’ axis to your
        liking, and it’s beautiful to boot. If a low-contrast, humanist
        sans-serif is more your speed, check out Commissioner, another
        worthwhile addition to the GF catalog. And if it’s feelings you’d rather
        flex, may we gently recommend Emoji Kitchen. Built by the Android
        Expressions team, this well-timed release allows you to express every
        emotional intersection by mashing up two emoji to create anything from
        kissy cowboy to fiery trash can. It is 2020, after all.
